# Numeric optimization of maritime flows - Cartographic application & Theorerical prospection

## Presentation


The final report (released under slides format) is available [here](docs/slides/diapo.pdf).

### Content

1. Problem's introduction & Main goals
2. Introduction to graph theory
3. Naive approach: relational track using fundamental graph theory with Dijkstra's algorithm (Shortest Path Problem)
4. Complexity (spatial and time) discussion and theorems results related to 
5. A refinement: Optimal geometrical approah using a grid system and new approximate heuristics using A-star algorithms
6. Discussion on the navigation systems: 4-directions, 8-directions and 360-system (respectively: Manhattan, Tchebychev and Euclidian distances)
7. Practical implementation of a cartographic application using the final weighted A-star algorithm (PA*)
8. Study of the spheric coordinates projections operators
9. Conclusion
10. Appendices


### Results

Here are some screenshots of final results of the application developed in the third section of this project.
